
Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis of Fibroblast Heterogeneity in Keloid and Normal Scar Tissues
- Processed and analyzed 12177 fibroblast cells from keloid and normal scar samples.
- Identified 2 distinct fibroblast subpopulations: KF, NF.
- Quantified subpopulation distributions and performed PCA-based mini 3D simulation.
- Generated interactive 3D visualization and static PCA 2D plot for CV and presentation purposes.
